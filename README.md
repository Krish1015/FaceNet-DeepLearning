# FaceNet-DeepLearning
Acknowledgement:
        First, after all, I want to thank my mentor for helping me through out the project. So many new concept, I learnt throughout the project tenure. I also want
        to thank Prof. Andrew Ng for his cource on courcera, that helps me a lot in this project with many concept of computer vision and convolution neural netwok.
My Learnings : - 
        1. Many concepts about image recognisation.
        2. How the matrixes are being formed in image detection.
        3. Images are classified by detecting the edges of the images.
        4. There can be plenty of parameter can be formed using CNN.
        5. Also learn many models of face recognisation.
        6. Use of tensorflow, keras.
        7. Use of layers - GlobalAveragePooling2D, Flatten.
Research paper studied :
        1. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (ResNet)
        2. Inception Net (Going deeper with convolutions)
        3. MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks
        4. DeepFace: Closing the Gap to Human-Level Performance in Face Verification
        5. FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering
